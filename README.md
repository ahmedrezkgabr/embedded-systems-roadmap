### Intro to CS
#### study one of the following courses (CS50 is recommended)
- [CS50: Computer Science Courses and Programs from Harvard](https://www.edx.org/cs50)
- [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)

### The C Programming Language
#### study the following books
- [C Programming A modern Approach](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd/dp/0393979504)
- [Understanding and Using C Pointers](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Using-Pointers-Techniques-Management/dp/1449344186)

#### practice writing C programs on the following websites
- [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [IndiaBix](https://www.indiabix.com/)
- [San Foundry](https://www.sanfoundry.com/)

### Data Structure and Algotithms
#### study the following book
- [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230)

#### study one of the following cources of discrete mathematics (Dr Waleed is recommended)
- [MA 112: Discrete Mathematics I (logic, basics, and foundations)](https://github.com/DrWaleedAYousef/Teaching/tree/master/DiscreteMathematics)
- [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/)
- [Descrete Mathematics Neso-Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2b2Vb-cYCs&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRhqJPDXcvYlLfXPh37L89g3)

#### study the following course on data structure
- [CS 214: Data Structures](https://github.com/DrWaleedAYousef/Teaching/tree/master/DataStructures)

#### to reach an advanced level in algorithms, study one of the follwoing courses
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) 
- [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms?page=9)


### Problem Solving Mindset
#### you need to practice your mind how to solve programmable problems
[Al-Azhar sheet](https://sites.google.com/view/azharicpc/) is highly recommended

#### good websites to practice and learn DS and Algorithms through problems:
- [LeetCode](https://interview.leetcode.com/interview/?gclid=CjwKCAjwvNaYBhA3EiwACgndggVHD-TZV0xhKDm30cLEFvO-hVww5R5XobFp5Pe4b8m87O153xU22hoCHQQQAvD_BwE) 

### Operating Systems
#### [Core Systems](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/README.md#core-systems) is a good source from the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu)

### Others
#### In computer science there are other core courses that are important, albeit not being of high importance to embedded systems fundamentals
- Networks
- OOP
- Data-bases


## Digital Design
#### study the following course
- [CS 221: Digital Design](https://github.com/DrWaleedAYousef/Teaching/tree/master/DigitalDesign)

## Electronics
#### if you feel that you have enough knowledge, skip this section.
#### you can reference to the following book
- [The Art of Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Electronics-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521809266)
